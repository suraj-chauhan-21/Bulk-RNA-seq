# Bulk-RNA-seq
RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is a powerful and widely used technique for studying the
transcriptome, the complete set of RNA transcripts produced by the genome under specific
conditions or in a specific cell type. Unlike traditional microarrays, RNA-Seq provides a high
resolution, quantitative, and unbiased view of gene expression, enabling researchers to
identify differentially expressed genes, discover novel transcripts, detect alternative splicing
events, and quantify gene expression across the entire genome
